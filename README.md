# Project Report

This report presents the findings of a data analytics
project named ‘Suicide analytics from pandemic time data in
Bangladesh’. The goal of the project was to identify the factors
that are most likely to lead a person to commit suicide and how
much Bangladesh is at risk in this regard.


## Introduction

Suicide has become a global warning nowadays. This
project aims to analyze suicide based dataset and discover
some pattern and insights which may help the concerned
persons the control this threat to some extent. The dataset
consists of several variables that provide insights into the
demographics, circumstances, and environmental factors asso-
ciated with these incidents. Each row in the dataset represents
a unique suicide case, with various attributes recorded for
analysis. By examining this data, we want to gain a deeper
understanding of the factors that may contribute to such
tragic events. In this report, we will explore the dataset using
descriptive and inferential statistics techniques.

## Findings and Insights

We have discovered some findings and insights based on
the analysis of the dataset. The findings might be unique to
the dataset and might not apply to larger populations or other
circumstances. These findings may need to be validated and
expanded upon by additional study and analysis. However,
these revelations can offer important knowledge to groups ded-
icated to preventing suicide, mental health professionals, and

awmakers. Targeted interventions and support systems can
be established to meet the unique requirements of vulnerable
people by comprehending demographic patterns, causes and
situations, and the possible effects of environmental factors.

1) Demographic Patterns:
• Age Group: The dataset includes individuals from differ-
ent age groups, such as ”YOUTH,” ”ADULT,” ”CHILD,”
”TEEN,” ”MIDDLE-AGED” and ”OLD.” Analysis re-
vealed that the majority of suicide cases were reported
in the ”TEEN” age group, followed by the ”YOUTH”
age group. This suggests that younger individuals may
be more vulnerable to suicidal tendencies.

• Gender: The dataset contains details on the gender of
those who were involved in the occurrences. According
to the analysis, there were more incidences of female
suicide than male suicide. This suggests that suicide rates
may differ by gender, with females being more likely to
commit suicide.

• Hometown: The dataset contains cases of different dis-
tricts of Bangladesh. After analysis we have found that
most of the cases occurred in “RAJSHAHI”, followed by
“BOGRA”. This indicates that people of these area are
at more suicidal risk.

2) Reasons and Circumstances:
• Reasons for Incidents: The dataset includes a variable
capturing the reason or motive behind each suicide case.
Analysis revealed that the most common reasons reported
were ” FAMILY ISSUE” followed by “RELATIOHSHIP
PROBLEM” and ” VIOLENCE.” This highlights the
importance of addressing these specific factors in suicide
prevention efforts.

• Time of Occurrence: The dataset offers details on what
time of day the incidents took place. Analysis revealed
that the ”NIGHT” and ”NOON” hours saw a dispropor-
tionately high number of suicide instances. For specific
time-of-day focused intervention tactics, this information
may be helpful.

3) Clustering Analysis:
• Cluster Identification: Using clustering methods, such as
K-means or DBSCAN clustering, the dataset was divided
into discrete clusters according to the chosen variables,
such as age group and month. The discovered clusters
can be used to find groups of people who share similar
traits or situations, offering information for specialized
prevention and support measures.


4) Environmental Factors:
• Weather Conditions: The dataset contains details on the
weather at the time of the incidents. Analysis revealed no
significant correlation between the frequency of suicide
incidents and weather (such as ”HAZE,” ”CLOUDS,”
or ”CLEAR”) conditions. This shows that the supplied
dataset’s suicide rates may not directly be influenced by
the weather.

## CONCLUSION
The examination of the suicide incident dataset has revealed
important information regarding a number of characteristics
including age groups, causes, contexts, and probable environ-
mental factors. The findings have implications for attempts to
prevent suicide as well as policy issues and give light on the
patterns and traits connected with these instances.
These findings contribute to the existing knowledge in the
area of suicide prevention and are helpful for organizations,
mental health practitioners, and policymakers who work in
this area. It is important to recognize the analysis’s limits,
though. The conclusions may be influenced by biases or
dataset restrictions because they are based on the data that is
currently available. The methodology also fails to adequately
account for the complex and diverse character of suicide
occurrences, and other variables not present in the dataset may
also have a big impact.
However, this analysis provides a basis for further research
and highlights the significance of evidence-based strategies,
stakeholder collaboration, and ongoing efforts in suicide pre-
vention and mental health assistance.
